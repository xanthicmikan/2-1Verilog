### ★Verification Stages   
* planning
* Testbench development
* Test creation
* Test execution
* Coverage analysis
* Debugging
* Closure
### ★Level
* Unit level
* Block level
* Subsystem level
* Chip level/SOC (System-on-Chip) level

### ★Constraint Random Verification (CRV)
* This is a technique for generating randomized test cases
  
### ★Here is a sample template of a verification plan
* Introduction
* Verification Environment
* Features to be Verified
* Test Plan
* Code/Functional/Assertion Coverage Plan
* Bug Tracking
* Sign-off Criteria

### ★Testbench
* Linear Testbench
* File Based Testbench
* State Machine Testbench
* Linear Random Testbench
* Self Checking Testbench
* 
### ★There are several types of RTL code coverage in SystemVerilog verification
* Statement coverage
* Branch coverage
* Condition coverage
* Expression coverage
* Toggle coverage
* Path coverage
* FSM coverage
