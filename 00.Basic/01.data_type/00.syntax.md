```
### 2. operator
```verilog
    x = ~y;                // ~ is a unary operator
    x = y | z;             // | is a binary operator
    x = (y > 5) ? w : z;   // ?: is a ternary operator
```

### 3. size
```verilog
    [size]'[base_format][number]
    ex:
       3'b010;     // size is 3, base format is binary ('b)
       3'd2;       // size is 3, base format is decimal ('d)
       8'h70;      // size is 8, base format is hexadecimal ('h)
```
